U.S. Legal Data Scraper with Selenium and Java

### TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
The project utilizes Selenium, a browser automation framework, in conjunction with Java, a widely used
programming language. Selenium WebDriver is employed to control a web browser and interact with web
elements. Java is chosen for its robustness, portability, and extensive library support, making it ideal for handling
the complexities of web scraping tasks.
### DATA COLLECTION PROCESS
The scraping process begins with identifying the target legal research site and the specific data to be collected:
court cases, statutes, and regulations. The next step involves analysing the website's structure to understand how
the data is organized and how to navigate to the relevant sections. Using Selenium WebDriver, the Java program
programmatically navigates to the website, bypasses any login requirements if necessary, and accesses the pages
containing the desired information. The program then extracts the relevant data, such as case names, dates,
statutes, and regulation details, by identifying the HTML elements that contain this information.
### HANDLING DYNAMIC CONTENT AND PAGINATION
Legal research sites often have dynamically loaded content and multiple pages of results (pagination). The project
addresses these challenges by implementing wait conditions in Selenium to ensure that all dynamic content is fully
loaded before data extraction. For pagination, the program iterates through pages of results, scraping data from
each page until all relevant information is collected.

RESULTS
--
The scraping operation successfully extracted data on court cases, statutes, and regulations from the target legal
research site. The collected data includes:
- Case names
- Dates of rulings
- Docket Id
- Statute titles and descriptions
- Regulation details and implications

This data is then structured and saved in a Json file for easy access and analysis. The Json format was chosen for its
simplicity and compatibility with various data analysis tools.
